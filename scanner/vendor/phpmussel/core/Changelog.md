### v3.0.0

[2020.07.20; Maikuolan] First stable release for the phpMussel v3 Core.

__*Why "v3.0.0" instead of "v1.0.0?"*__ Prior to phpMussel v3, the "phpMussel Core", "phpMussel CLI-mode", "phpMussel Front-End", and "phpMussel Uploads Handler" ("phpMussel Web") were all bundled together as a single repository (phpMussel/phpMussel). Since phpMussel v3, these each all have their own, separate repositories. I've opted to start releases at this repository (phpMussel/Core) at *v3.0.0*, in order to avoid confusion with previous versions of the "phpMussel Core" which exist outside this repository.

### v3.0.1

[2020.07.31; Maikuolan]: Improved the way that the (generated by ...) notice, displayed at the footer of HTML pages, is rendered.

[2020.08.05; Maikuolan]: Addressed a potential compatibility problem with some specific kinds of symlinked installations.

[2020.10.01; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Discovered that the image chameleon attack detection could generate false positives against Mac OS X thumbnails; Fixed. *Refer [#223](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/223).*

### v3.0.2

[2020.10.01; Bug-fix; v10mthibault]: Typo in Loader.php; Trying to call function sprint instead of sprintf which leads to an error; Fixed.

[2020.10.15; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Wrong number of files reported when recursively scanning through directories; Fixed. *Refer [#225](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/225).*

### v3.0.3

[2020.10.18; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: A small, minor scan optimisation mechanism found to be faulty, causing signatures to sometimes be skipped when not intended; Removed it. *Refer [#224](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/issues/224).*

### v3.1.0

[2020.11.20; Maikuolan]: Added partial support for detecting objects and files embedded within pdf files (due to the nature of how this has been implemented, for the purpose of scanning these embedded objects and files, phpMussel will regard pdf as an archive format; this is intentional).

[2020.11.26; Maikuolan]: Ditched external test frameworks in favour of GitHub Actions. Replaced existing tests. (More work needs to eventually be done towards tests. This will eventually happen at some point).

[2020.11.27; Maikuolan]: Some minor code-style cleanup.

[2020.12.04; Maikuolan]: Maintenance release (dependencies update, repository cleanup, etc).

### v3.2.0

[2021.01.10; Maikuolan]: Separated the code for performing outbound requests through cURL out to its own independent class.

[2021.02.05; Maikuolan]: The default timeout for external requests is now configurable.

[2021.02.07; Maikuolan]: Added the ability to hide the phpMussel version used.

### v3.2.1

[2021.03.11; Maikuolan]: Added some missing return type declarations.

[2021.04.19; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: BuildPath could potentially trigger warnings when open_basedir is defined, causing logging, among various other internal file operations, to fail (related to PHP bug 69240); Fixed.

[2021.05.01; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Log truncation not being calculated properly; Fixed.

[2021.05.28; Maikuolan]: Performed some minor refactoring.

[2021.05.28; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Wrong casing used for some variables would cause undefined variable errors to occur; Fixed (#3).
